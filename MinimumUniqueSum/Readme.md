Goal was to return an int that shows the minimum total sum of the array after
they are all unique by incrementing the array's value.

example:

      Given: [1,2,3]
  
      Return: 6
  
      Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  
      Since they are all unique it just adds up the array
example:

      Given: [2,2,2]
  
      Return: 9
  
      Explanation: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
                
      Since the first 2 is unique it stays 2, 
                
      while the second 2 increase by 1 to make 3
                
      and finally since the last 2 can't be 2 or 3 after incrementing it becomes 4
